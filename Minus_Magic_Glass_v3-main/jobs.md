## 4. Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Date | Details |
|----------|------|---------|
| Pedagogy: Narrator teaches, Minu reacts | June 16 | Minu never teaches — she only reacts emotionally. Narrator is the teacher. |
| Two-voice audio system | June 16 | Pre-recorded MP3 files instead of Web Speech API TTS |
| 58 dialogue lines total | June 16 | 28 narrator + 30 Minu lines (see `minu-dialogues.txt`) |
| Team-based module building | June 16 | Each teammate builds one level independently, Buffy integrates |
| Module interface contract | June 16 | LevelModule type with levelId, config, component |
| Sound toggle gates all audio | June 16 | Master `_soundEnabled` flag in `lib/audio.ts` |
| Responsive: `min-h-dvh` not `min-h-screen` | June 16 | For proper mobile viewport handling |
| Level 5 redesign: analysis pipeline | June 16 | Replaced abstract importance sliders with 4-step analysis pipeline (brightness, color, edges, features) that directly connects to Levels 1-4 concepts |
| Level 5: 12 images, 80% threshold, dynamic quiz | June 17 | Expanded from 5 to 12 images across 5 categories. Quiz unlocks only after all images classified with ≥80% accuracy. Quiz generates 5+ dynamic questions from a 12-question pool (shuffled each attempt). Level only marked calibrated on quiz success. |
| Narrator MP3 audio integration | June 17 | Added `playNarratorFile()` to `lib/audio.ts` using HTML5 Audio API. Wired 11 existing narrator MP3s: welcome (first-time/returning via localStorage), sound toggle confirmation, map explanation, quiz feedback (alternating clips), level complete, all-complete. Sound toggle plays "on" before mute so it's audible. |
| Sound toggle fix: on/off confirmation | June 17 | Added `temporarilyEnableSound()` and `restoreSoundState()` to `lib/audio.ts`. Sound toggle now plays `narrator_sound_off.mp3` BEFORE muting (with 200ms delay to let audio start). Both on and off confirmation sounds are now audible. |
| Map narrator one-shot | June 17 | `playMapExplainOnce()` in `lib/audio.ts` — session-level guard so map explain doesn't replay after level complete. |
| Level complete timeout fix | June 17 | `playNarratorFile({ onEnd })` waits for MP3 to finish before returning to Planet Map. |
| Planet Map solar-system UI | June 18 | Replaced 5-card grid with orbit carousel: center planet + neighbors visible, idle animations, `mapFocusLevelId` persists focus after complete/back. |
| Circular wrap-around orbit | June 18 | Planets on a closed ring — level 5 sits left of level 1, navigation wraps infinitely in both directions. |
| Wide orbit + keyboard nav | June 18 | Orbit radius scales with screen width; ← → arrow keys navigate planets on Planet Map. |
| Planet PNGs + larger display | June 18 | User assets in `public/images/planets/`; sizes 280/180/120px; bounce + glow effects. |
| Testing unlock all levels | June 18 | `TESTING_UNLOCK_ALL_LEVELS` flag bypasses planet locks until release. |
| Kid-friendly fonts | June 18 | Fredoka for headings app-wide; Pixelify retained for home title neon only; larger body text. |
| Level 5 Object Detection redesign | June 18 | Reference + 16-tile multi-select × 5 rounds; quiz 4/5 pass. User: 16×4-pack sheets → 57 PNGs; dev: transforms + grid in code. Spec: `level5_assets/level5_asset.txt`. |
| Level 5 module implemented | June 18 | 65 character PNGs wired; `lib/level5-object-detection.ts`; activity + quiz live. |
| Level 5 UI theme polish | June 18 | Left mission column (reference, Minu, status card, star counter, hints); arcade neon styling. |
| Dev server webpack mode | June 18 | `npm run dev` uses `--webpack` to prevent Turbopack os error 32 file-lock panics on Windows. |

## 6. How to Resume After Session Termination

1. **Read this file** (`jobs.md`) — it has everything
2. **Check what's waiting** — Section 3 tells you exactly what files to provide
3. **Tell Buffy** what you've completed (e.g., "I placed the MP3 files")
4. **Buffy will pick up** from where we left off

---

## 7. Commands Reference

```bash
# Start dev server (webpack — stable on Windows; avoids Turbopack file-lock 500s)
cd G:/Cursor/FreeBuff/minu-s-magic-glasses && npm run dev

# Typecheck
cd G:/Cursor/FreeBuff/minu-s-magic-glasses && npx tsc --noEmit

# Check if dev server is running
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
```
